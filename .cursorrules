# Vibecoder Rules for Token Tracker
- I am learning. Explain complex patterns in comments.
- Use functional React components only.
- Tailwind CSS for all styling (use shadcn components when possible).
- Mobile-first responsive design.
- Supabase for backend (auth, database, storage).
- No explanations unless I ask—just write the code.
- If you're unsure, ask me to clarify before generating.
